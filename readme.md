This repository contains some example components meant for educational/inspirational
purposes. These are components that we open source to encourage experimentation but
these are components that are **not officially supported**. There will be some tests 
as well as some documentation but this project has low priority status when it comes
to maintainance. 

# Components 

The following components are implemented. 

### Meta 

- `rasa_nlu_examples.meta.Printer`: a printer that's useful for debugging

## Dense Featurizers 

- `rasa_nlu_examples.featurizers.dense_featurizer.FastText`: fasttext word embeddings
