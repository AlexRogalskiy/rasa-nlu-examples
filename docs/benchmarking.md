# Benchmarking Guide

This is a small guide that will explain how you can use the tools in this library to run benchmarks.
The caveat here is that these tools are experimental in nature. We want this repository to be a place
where folks can share their nlu components and experiment, but this also means that we don't want to
suggest that these tools are state of the art. You always need to check if these tools work for your
pipeline and the components that we host here may very well lag behind a version of Rasa.

That said, here's a small guide on how to use some of the features.

## Sara Demo

As an example project we'll use the Sara demo.
